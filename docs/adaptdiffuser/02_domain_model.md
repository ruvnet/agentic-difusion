## 3. State Transitions

### 3.1 Adaptation Process
1. Initial state: Unadapted model with baseline planning capabilities
2. Task introduction: Model receives task specification and creates task embedding
3. Adaptation: Model adjusts using reward gradients and relevant trajectories
4. Evaluation: Model performance is evaluated on the task
5. Self-improvement: Model generates synthetic data filtered by the discriminator
6. Refinement: Model fine-tunes using high-quality synthetic data
7. Final state: Adapted model with improved planning for the specific task

### 3.2 Trajectory Generation Process
1. Initial state: Random noise or conditioned starting point
2. Iterative denoising: Progressive denoising guided by reward gradients
3. Quality evaluation: Generated trajectory evaluated by reward model
4. Memory update: High-quality trajectories stored in buffer
5. Final state: Complete, high-quality trajectory for the planning task

## 4. Invariants and Business Rules

### 4.1 Model Invariants
- Reward functions must always return finite, bounded values
- Task embeddings must maintain consistent dimensionality
- Trajectory quality must be normalized between 0 and 1

### 4.2 Business Rules
- The model should prioritize adaptation to tasks with lower performance
- Synthetic data generation should maintain diversity to prevent mode collapse
- Model updates should preserve performance on previously seen tasks
- Security credentials and sensitive parameters must never be embedded in the model
