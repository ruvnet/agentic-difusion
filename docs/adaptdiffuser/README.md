# AdaptDiffuser Implementation Specifications

This directory contains the comprehensive specifications for implementing AdaptDiffuser in the agentic_diffusion project. AdaptDiffuser integrates reinforcement learning with diffusion models, enabling the system to adapt planning strategies based on task-specific rewards and self-evolve through synthetic data generation.

## Specification Documents

1. [**Requirements Specification**](01_requirements.md) - Defines the functional, integration, performance, and security requirements for the AdaptDiffuser implementation.

2. [**Domain Model**](02_domain_model.md) - Outlines the core entities, relationships, state transitions, and business rules for the AdaptDiffuser implementation.

3. [**Component Architecture**](03_component_architecture.md) - Details the core components, integration components, component interactions, and security considerations for the AdaptDiffuser implementation.

4. [**Interface Specifications**](04_interface_specifications.md) - Provides detailed class interfaces and method signatures for implementing the AdaptDiffuser components.

5. [**Implementation Plan**](05_implementation_plan.md) - Outlines the phases, tasks, dependencies, milestones, and risk mitigation strategies for implementing AdaptDiffuser.

6. [**Security Specifications**](06_security_specifications.md) - Focuses on security principles, authentication, authorization, secure configuration, data protection, and secure development practices.

## Key Features

- **Adaptive Self-Evolution**: Enables diffusion models to adapt planning strategies based on task-specific rewards and self-evolve through synthetic data generation.
- **Reward-Guided Sampling**: Uses reward signals to guide the diffusion process towards high-quality trajectories.
- **Task Adaptation**: Supports adaptation to both seen and unseen tasks without requiring additional expert data.
- **Integration with Existing Framework**: Seamlessly integrates with the existing adaptation mechanisms in the agentic_diffusion framework.

## Security Focus

The specifications place a strong emphasis on security, ensuring:
- No hardcoded secrets or credentials
- Secure configuration management
- Proper authentication and authorization
- Data protection in transit and at rest
- Input validation and sanitization
- Secure development practices

## Implementation Guidelines

Follow these guidelines when implementing AdaptDiffuser:

1. **Follow the Interface Specifications**: Ensure all components implement the interfaces defined in the interface specifications document.
2. **Adhere to Security Requirements**: Implement all security controls as defined in the security specifications.
3. **Use Existing Components**: Leverage existing components in the agentic_diffusion framework whenever possible.
4. **Follow the Implementation Plan**: Implement the components in the order specified in the implementation plan.
5. **Maintain High Test Coverage**: Ensure comprehensive testing of all components and interactions.

## Contribution Guidelines

When contributing to the AdaptDiffuser implementation:

1. Ensure all code follows the project's coding standards
2. Write comprehensive tests for all features
3. Document all public APIs and components
4. Address all security considerations
5. Update specification documents as needed to reflect implementation details
