# AdaptDiffuser: Security Specifications

## 1. Security Principles

The AdaptDiffuser implementation must adhere to the following core security principles:

1. **No Hardcoded Secrets**: Under no circumstances should credentials, API keys, or sensitive configuration be hardcoded in source code.
2. **Defense in Depth**: Multiple layers of security controls should be implemented.
3. **Least Privilege**: Components should operate with the minimum permissions necessary.
4. **Secure by Default**: Default configurations should be secure without additional configuration.
5. **Input Validation**: All inputs should be validated and sanitized before processing.

## 2. Authentication and Authorization

### 2.1 Authentication Requirements

- **API Access Control**:
  - All API endpoints must require authentication
  - Authentication mechanisms should support API keys or OAuth 2.0
  - Authentication failures must be logged with appropriate details

- **Service-to-Service Authentication**:
  - Services must authenticate with mutual TLS or API keys
  - No hardcoded service credentials allowed in source code or configuration files
  - Credentials must be rotated periodically

### 2.2 Authorization Requirements

- **Role-Based Access Control**:
  - Define specific roles for users (Admin, User, ReadOnly)
  - Implement permission checks in API endpoints
  - Separate model training permissions from inference permissions

- **Resource Access Control**:
  - Implement controls for access to trajectory buffers
  - Restrict access to model weights and adaptation mechanisms
  - Limit the rate of adaptation requests per user/task

## 3. Secure Configuration Management

### 3.1 Environment Variables

- **Required Environment Variables**:
  - `ADAPTDIFFUSER_API_KEY`: API key for external services (if needed)
  - `ADAPTDIFFUSER_MODEL_STORAGE`: Path to secure model storage
  - `ADAPTDIFFUSER_ENCRYPTION_KEY`: Key for encrypting sensitive data

- **Environment Variable Guidelines**:
  - Never log environment variable values
  - Use appropriate tools for environment management in different environments
  - Include validation for required environment variables on startup

### 3.2 Configuration Files

- **Secure Configuration Files**:
  - Sensitive configuration must be stored in secure configuration stores
  - Configuration files with sensitive data must be excluded from version control
  - Template configuration files should include appropriate default values

- **Configuration Validation**:
  - Validate all configuration values on system initialization
  - Fail startup if security-related configuration is missing or invalid
  - Log configuration errors with appropriate detail (without exposing secrets)

### 3.3 Secrets Management

- **Acceptable Secrets Storage**:
  - Environment variables in production environments
  - Secure secret management services (e.g., AWS Secrets Manager, HashiCorp Vault)
  - Encrypted configuration files with access controls

- **Prohibited Secrets Storage**:
  - Source code (including comments or strings)
  - Unencrypted configuration files
  - Debug logs or error messages
  - Version control systems

## 4. Data Protection

### 4.1 Data in Transit

- **Encryption Requirements**:
  - All API communication must use TLS 1.2+
  - Internal service communication must be encrypted
  - Certificate validation must be enforced

- **API Security**:
  - Implement appropriate CORS policies
  - Set secure HTTP headers
  - Use HTTPS only

### 4.2 Data at Rest

- **Model Storage Security**:
  - Encrypt sensitive model parameters
  - Implement access controls for model files
  - Regularly audit access to model storage

- **Trajectory Buffer Security**:
  - Anonymize or encrypt sensitive trajectory data
  - Implement retention policies for trajectory data
  - Ensure secure deletion when data is no longer needed

### 4.3 Memory Protection

- **Memory Handling**:
  - Clear sensitive data from memory when no longer needed
  - Avoid memory dumps that could expose sensitive information
  - Implement secure coding practices to prevent memory-based attacks

## 5. Input Validation and Sanitization

### 5.1 API Input Validation

- **Parameter Validation**:
  - Validate all API parameters for type, format, and range
  - Implement strict JSON schema validation for complex inputs
  - Reject requests with invalid parameters

- **Task Specification Validation**:
  - Validate task specifications for format and content
  - Sanitize task descriptions to prevent injection attacks
  - Enforce size limits on task specifications

### 5.2 Model Input Validation

- **Trajectory Validation**:
  - Validate trajectory format and dimensions
  - Check for adversarial inputs that could compromise the model
  - Implement trajectory normalization

- **Reward Function Validation**:
  - Validate custom reward functions
  - Sanitize reward function inputs
  - Enforce bounds on reward values

## 6. Secure Development Practices

### 6.1 Code Security

- **Secure Coding Standards**:
  - Follow the project's established coding standards
  - Implement proper error handling without exposing sensitive information
  - Use safe API methods and avoid dangerous functions

- **Dependency Management**:
  - Keep dependencies up to date
  - Regularly audit dependencies for vulnerabilities
  - Use lockfiles to ensure consistent dependency versions

### 6.2 Testing and Validation

- **Security Testing**:
  - Implement tests for security controls
  - Include tests for authentication and authorization
  - Validate input handling and error cases

- **Static Analysis**:
  - Use static analysis tools to identify security issues
  - Enforce security linting in CI/CD pipeline
  - Address all high and critical security findings

### 6.3 Deployment Security

- **Secure Deployment Process**:
  - Validate all artifacts before deployment
  - Use secured deployment pipelines
  - Implement proper access controls for deployment environments

- **Runtime Security**:
  - Run services with least privilege
  - Implement resource limits to prevent DoS
  - Enable appropriate logging for security events

## 7. Logging and Monitoring

### 7.1 Security Logging

- **Required Security Events**:
  - Authentication attempts (success/failure)
  - Authorization failures
  - Model adaptation operations
  - Configuration changes
  - Unusual traffic patterns

- **Log Format Requirements**:
  - Include timestamp, event type, user/service identity
  - Log sufficient context for investigation
  - Never log sensitive data (credentials, tokens, model parameters)

### 7.2 Security Monitoring

- **Monitoring Requirements**:
  - Monitor authentication and authorization failures
  - Track unusual adaptation patterns
  - Alert on configuration changes
  - Monitor system resource usage

- **Response Procedures**:
  - Define procedures for security incidents
  - Establish responsibility for incident response
  - Document recovery procedures
