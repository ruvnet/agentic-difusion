# AdaptDiffuser: Requirements Specification

## 1. Project Overview

AdaptDiffuser integrates reinforcement learning with diffusion models, enabling the system to adapt its planning strategies based on task-specific rewards. This implementation will extend the agentic_diffusion framework with self-evolutionary capabilities for both seen and unseen tasks.

## 2. Functional Requirements

### 2.1 Core Functionality

- **FR1.1:** Implement AdaptDiffuser as a specialized diffusion model that can evolve planning strategies based on reward signals
- **FR1.2:** Support adaptive trajectory generation guided by task-specific rewards
- **FR1.3:** Implement self-evolutionary mechanisms to improve planning capabilities through synthetic data generation
- **FR1.4:** Enable adaptation to unseen tasks without requiring additional expert data
- **FR1.5:** Support both conditional and unconditional trajectory generation

### 2.2 Integration Requirements

- **FR2.1:** Seamlessly integrate with existing adaptation mechanisms in the agentic_diffusion framework
- **FR2.2:** Provide consistent interfaces compatible with existing API structure
- **FR2.3:** Leverage existing noise schedules and denoising processes
- **FR2.4:** Support both CPU and GPU execution environments

### 2.3 Performance Requirements

- **FR3.1:** Achieve at least 20% performance improvement over baseline diffusion models on planning tasks
- **FR3.2:** Maintain reasonable adaptation speed for online learning scenarios
- **FR3.3:** Optimize memory usage to handle large trajectory buffers efficiently

## 3. Security Requirements

- **SR1.1:** Implement secure parameter management with no hardcoded credentials or secrets
- **SR1.2:** Use environment variables or secure configuration files for any sensitive information
- **SR1.3:** Implement appropriate access controls for adaptation mechanisms
- **SR1.4:** Sanitize all inputs to prevent injection attacks
- **SR1.5:** Validate and sanitize all loaded model checkpoints

## 4. Constraints

- **C1.1:** Must integrate with the existing agentic_diffusion architecture
- **C1.2:** Must maintain compatibility with PyTorch 1.9+
- **C1.3:** Implementation must follow the project's established patterns and coding standards
- **C1.4:** No hardcoded paths or environment-specific configurations
- **C1.5:** All security credentials must be managed through secure environment variables

## 5. Edge Cases

- **EC1.1:** Handle scenarios where reward signals are sparse or noisy
- **EC1.2:** Gracefully recover from adaptation failure without corrupting the model
- **EC1.3:** Handle out-of-memory situations when dealing with large trajectory buffers
- **EC1.4:** Properly manage numerical instability during gradient updates
- **EC1.5:** Handle scenarios where task characteristics change during adaptation

## 6. Acceptance Criteria

- **AC1.1:** AdaptDiffuser successfully integrates with existing adaptation mechanisms
- **AC1.2:** Model demonstrates measurable improvement in planning quality versus baseline models
- **AC1.3:** Can adapt to unseen tasks without requiring additional expert data
- **AC1.4:** Passes all security review criteria with no critical vulnerabilities
- **AC1.5:** Achieves test coverage of at least 90%
- **AC1.6:** Successfully runs in both CPU and GPU environments
