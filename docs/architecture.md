# Agentic Diffusion Architecture Specification

This document outlines the high-level architecture for the Agentic Diffusion implementation based on AdaptDiffuser, focusing on modular design, extensibility, and integration patterns.

## 1. System Overview

The Agentic Diffusion system is a modular, extensible framework for diffusion-based code generation and agentic planning. It leverages diffusion models as adaptive self-evolving planners, incorporating recursive self-optimization while maintaining algorithmic coherence across all components.

### 1.1 Core Architectural Principles

1. **Modularity**: System is divided into loosely coupled, independently deployable components
2. **Extensibility**: All core abstractions support extension points for customization
3. **Layered Design**: Clear separation of concerns with well-defined interfaces between layers
4. **Testability**: Architecture supports comprehensive testing with >90% coverage
5. **Adaptability**: Components can adapt to new tasks and domains without retraining
6. **Coherence**: Consistent patterns and representations across all components
