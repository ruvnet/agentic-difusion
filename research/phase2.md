Understood. I’ll create a complete implementation blueprint for a diffusion-based refinement system tailored to broad, complex software systems using Test-Driven Development (TDD). This will include architecture, components, and step-by-step implementation guidance with code examples.

I’ll get started and update you when it’s ready.


# Diffusion-Based Code Refinement System for TDD

## Overview and Key Concepts

Developing **complex software systems with Test-Driven Development (TDD)** can benefit from AI assistance that iteratively refines code until all tests pass. We propose a **diffusion-based code refinement system** that treats code generation as a gradual denoising process – starting from a noisy or skeletal implementation and refining it into a fully functional solution through multiple iterations. The system tightly integrates with TDD by using test results as feedback at each step, ensuring the code converges to a state where **unit, integration, and system tests all pass**. Key features include:

* **Diffusion-Inspired Code Generation:** An iterative refinement engine begins with incomplete or placeholder code and incrementally transforms it toward a correct solution, analogous to how diffusion models denoise data. This yields more diverse and syntactically correct code compared to one-shot generation.
* **Multi-Module and Multi-System Support:** The system handles broad codebases (monoliths with many modules or microservices architectures) by generating and updating multiple files coherently. It maintains a shared understanding of interfaces and data models across components.
* **TDD Feedback Loop (Red/Green Tests):** Unit tests, integration tests, and end-to-end system tests provide a **feedback signal**. After each code generation step, tests are executed; any failures (the “red” stage in TDD) are analyzed to guide the next refinement. This **execute-and-refine loop** continues until the code passes all tests (the “green” stage).
* **Recursive Self-Optimization:** The system learns from each refinement cycle. It logs test failures and code changes, identifying patterns (e.g. off-by-one errors, incorrect API usage) and adapting its generation strategy or prompt to avoid repeating mistakes. Over time, it becomes more efficient at producing test-passing code.
* **Algorithmic Coherence via Shared Representations:** All components – the generator, test analyzer, and coherence checker – operate on common representations of the code and specifications. Abstract syntax trees (ASTs), interface contracts (function signatures, data schemas), and even semantic embeddings are shared to ensure consistency across files and iterations.
* **CPU and GPU Compatibility:** The implementation uses PyTorch for model inference, allowing acceleration on GPUs during intensive refinement cycles, while remaining runnable on CPUs for development and testing. The design abstracts hardware specifics so the same code can leverage available GPUs or fall back to CPU.

By combining these elements, the system embodies best practices from AI-assisted software engineering research. For example, providing tests as part of the prompt has been shown to significantly improve code generation success, and incorporating execution feedback enables dynamic correction of errors. We now detail the system’s architecture and components, followed by the implementation and an example workflow.

## Architecture Overview

&#x20;*Figure: High-level architecture of the diffusion-based code refinement system.* The system comprises several modules working in concert in an iterative loop:

* **Diffusion Code Generator:** a neural code generation engine (inspired by diffusion models) that proposes code solutions. It takes as input the current “noisy” code state and the test specifications (and optionally the recent test failure feedback) and produces a refined code version.
* **Coherence & AST Manager:** a component that parses code into an AST and checks for consistency with expected interfaces/contracts. It ensures that all modules remain compatible (e.g. function signatures match what tests or other modules expect) before execution. It can modify or constrain the generated code to maintain coherence (for example, inserting any missing function definitions that tests call).
* **Test Execution & Feedback Collector:** this module runs the test suite (unit tests, integration tests, system tests) against the current codebase. It captures the results and any failure information (assertion messages, stack traces, etc.).
* **Feedback Analyzer & Prompt Adapter:** interprets test failures to identify *what went wrong* (e.g. wrong return value, exception thrown, performance issue) and formulates feedback to the generator. This often comes in the form of an updated prompt or input embedding for the generator (for the next iteration) that highlights the observed errors.
* **Self-Optimizer:** monitors the refinement cycles over time. It logs each iteration’s outcome and adjusts system behavior for future iterations or projects. For instance, if certain error patterns recur, it may adjust the generator’s prompts or even fine-tune the model on those cases, achieving a form of continual learning.
* **Codebase State (Multiple Files):** the evolving code across one or more files or services. After each refinement, the codebase is updated (one or several files may change). The entire codebase (or relevant parts of it) serves as context for the next generation step to ensure subsequent changes don’t regress previously passing tests.

The workflow moves through these components in a loop. Initially, the codebase might be just skeletons (function stubs, classes with `pass` or minimal implementations). The Diffusion Generator uses the test suite (which defines the requirements) to produce an initial code attempt. The Coherence manager ensures everything is syntactically and semantically in place (e.g., all functions the tests call do exist in the code). Then the Test Runner executes the tests. If failures occur, the feedback analyzer summarizes them (e.g., “function `foo` returned 0 but expected 5 for input X”) and the Self-Optimizer logs the iteration. This feedback is fed into the generator for the next refinement round.

This iterative refinement continues, gradually “denoising” the code. In the beginning, many tests fail (high “noise” in the solution), but with each iteration, the code aligns closer to the specification defined by the tests. Eventually, all tests pass (zero failures), and the process terminates with a correct implementation. This approach mirrors the TDD cycle of **“red → green → refactor”**: the system automatically goes from red (failing tests) to green (passing tests) by refactoring the code with AI guidance at each step.

## Diffusion-Inspired Code Refinement Engine

At the heart of the system is a **diffusion-inspired code generation model**. Instead of producing perfect code in one step, it generates code through *iterative refinement*. This concept is drawn from diffusion models in AI, which start from random noise and iteratively apply a denoising process to generate a coherent output (often guided by a condition). In our case, the “noise” is an incomplete or incorrect code draft, and the condition is the specification given by tests and any other requirements.

**How it works:** We represent the current code (which may have placeholders or incorrect logic) in a latent space and gradually refine it. A PyTorch-based model (such as a Transformer) serves as the *denoiser*. At each refinement step `t`, the model receives (a) an encoding of the test specifications and known requirements, (b) an encoding of the current code state (with a representation of its “noise” or uncertainty), and (c) the step index or an analogous diffusion timestep. It then predicts a slightly improved code. Over several steps (t = T, T-1, ..., 1), the code transitions from a noisy draft to a candidate solution.

**Model architecture:** We can implement the diffusion generator with a Transformer-based neural network similar to recent diffusion models for code. For example, the **CodeFusion** architecture uses an encoder for the natural language spec (in our case, the tests can be treated as spec), a Transformer-based denoiser for code embeddings, and a decoder to output code tokens. In our system, the encoder would process test descriptions (and perhaps partial code context), and the denoiser/decoder would iteratively correct the code. Unlike standard autoregressive models that generate one token at a time, the diffusion model considers the entire program vector at once, allowing it to enforce consistency across the output. This approach has been shown to produce syntactically correct outputs more often than autoregressive models and can even outperform larger conventional models in some cases.

Under the hood, the diffusion engine might sample an initial code vector (e.g., a random initialization or an embedding of a trivial baseline implementation) and then perform a sequence of denoising steps. At each step, it uses the test suite context to guide code formation. By the final step, we decode the vector into actual source code. The model can be configured to generate multiple candidate implementations if needed (which could be run in parallel through tests to pick a winner, similar to how DeepMind’s AlphaCode generates many samples and selects those that pass tests).

To integrate with the rest of the system, the DiffusionEngine exposes an interface like `generate_code(tests, current_code, feedback) -> new_code`. Here:

* **tests:** are the test cases or a representation of them (could be the raw test code, or a summary like “function X should return Y on input Z” extracted from tests).
* **current\_code:** the existing implementation (initially just stubs, later the last iteration’s code).
* **feedback:** an optional parameter containing specific failure info from the last test run (e.g., “Test 5 failed: expected 5, got 3”). The engine can incorporate this to focus on fixing that issue (for example, appending the error message to the model prompt or adjusting the conditioning vector).

**PyTorch Implementation:** Below is a simplified implementation outline of the diffusion code generator. We define a model that could encapsulate an encoder for test specs and a generator network for code. For brevity, we use a stubbed Transformer from PyTorch and focus on the API and integration points:

```python
import torch
import torch.nn as nn

class DiffusionCodeGenerator:
    def __init__(self, device=torch.device("cpu")):
        # Initialize a simple transformer or diffusion model components.
        d_model = 256
        self.device = device
        # Encoder to embed test specification (could be text or structured input)
        self.spec_encoder = nn.TransformerEncoder(nn.TransformerEncoderLayer(d_model=d_model, nhead=8), num_layers=4).to(device)

        return spec_encoding

    def generate_initial_code_embedding(self, code_stub_text):
        # Create an initial code embedding from current code (which may be empty or partial).
        # In a true diffusion model, this might start as random noise. Here we use token embeddings.
        code_tokens = torch.randint(0, 5000, (max(len(code_stub_text.split()), 1),))
        code_emb = self.token_embedding(code_tokens.to(self.device)).unsqueeze(1)  # [seq_len, 1, d_model]
        return code_emb

    def refine_code_once(self, spec_encoding, code_emb):
        # One refinement step: use transformer (denoiser) with spec encoding as context (encoder-decoder attention).
        # PyTorch nn.Transformer can be used by feeding spec as "memory" to the decoder.
        out = self.denoiser(src=spec_encoding, tgt=code_emb)  # get refined code embeddings
        return out

    def decode_code(self, code_emb):
        # Map refined code embeddings back to discrete tokens and text (greedy decoding for simplicity)
        logits = self.output_head(code_emb.squeeze(1))  # shape [seq_len, vocab_size]
        token_indices = logits.argmax(dim=-1)  # pick highest logit token at each position
        # (In practice, we'd handle this carefully and possibly use the entire sequence or stop at EOS token)
        tokens = token_indices.cpu().numpy().tolist()
        # Convert token indices back to code text (this is a placeholder; a real system would have a tokenizer)
        code_text = " ".join(f"<{tok}>" for tok in tokens)
        return code_text

    def generate_code(self, test_spec, current_code, max_steps=3, feedback=None):
        """

```

*Code Explanation:* In this simplified code, `DiffusionCodeGenerator` defines a model with an encoder and a transformer to represent the diffusion process. The `generate_code` method takes a `test_spec` (which could be a string or list of test case descriptions) and an optional `current_code`. It encodes the spec (and any feedback) and generates an initial code embedding (randomly, for illustration). It then runs a fixed number of refinement steps (`max_steps=3` here) – in a real diffusion model, this loop might run for tens of steps gradually reducing noise. Finally, it decodes the embedding to a token sequence and returns a pseudo-code text. The actual output in this dummy example will be gibberish because we didn’t train the model (we used random tokens), but in a real system this would produce a refined code implementation.

**Note:** In practice, one would load a pre-trained model (perhaps fine-tuned on code) rather than instantiate random layers, and use a proper tokenizer for code. Libraries like Hugging Face’s Transformers or Diffusers could facilitate building such a model. The concept remains that the generator can incorporate test feedback (as we did by appending a feedback string to the spec) to focus the refinement on failing aspects.

The diffusion-based approach not only enables iterative improvement but also **supports parallelism** – in principle multiple refinement chains can be run with different noise seeds, generating multiple candidate solutions that all satisfy the tests in the end. This is analogous to how diffusion image generators can produce many variations. Moreover, diffusion models can leverage massive parallel GPU computations during generation (since each step can operate on all tokens simultaneously), which is one reason tools like Mercury’s diffusion LLM achieved up to *6× faster* generation than standard autoregressive LLMs. In summary, the DiffusionEngine provides a powerful and flexible way to explore the solution space of code with guidance from tests at each iteration.

## Integration with Test-Driven Development (Feedback Loop)

The system is designed to mirror and automate the TDD cycle: **write tests → generate code → run tests → use failures to improve code**. The presence of a comprehensive test suite is assumed (as per TDD, tests are written before the implementation). These tests act as the specification for what the code should do. The integration works as follows:

1. **Test-informed Generation:** The test cases (unit tests specifying individual functions’ expected behavior, integration tests specifying how modules interact, etc.) are fed into the code generator. This ensures the initial code attempts are not made in a vacuum but are *conditioned on the requirements*. Research shows that supplying test cases to an LLM dramatically improves its success rate in coding tasks. Here we leverage that by making tests a first-class input to the generator.
2. **Executing Tests (Red Phase):** After code generation, the **Test Execution** module runs the entire test suite on the generated code. We can use Python’s `unittest` or `pytest` frameworks programmatically to do this. Each test result is collected. If all tests pass on the first try, we’re done (this is rare for non-trivial problems, just as a human rarely gets it perfect in one go).
3. **Failure Analysis:** If some tests fail (the norm), we enter the *red* phase of TDD where the code is known to be incorrect. The system inspects each failure. Typical information gathered includes:

   * **Assertion failures:** e.g., “AssertionError: expected 42 but got 0 on input x=7”. From this, the system deduces that the logic didn’t produce the expected result for that case.
   * **Exceptions or errors:** e.g., `AttributeError: 'NoneType' object has no attribute 'append'` which might indicate a variable wasn’t initialized properly.
   * **Test logs or printouts:** If tests are written to log intermediate values, these can be captured to understand the code’s behavior.
   * **Performance or timeout issues:** If a test times out or fails performance criteria, the feedback might note that the implementation is too slow for certain input sizes.
   * **Integration mismatches:** For integration tests, a failure might indicate that two modules aren’t interacting correctly (e.g., data format mismatch or incorrect API usage).
4. **Feedback Loop (Green Phase):** The collected feedback is transformed into a useful form for the generator. For example, the system might create a summary like:

   * *“Test `test_add_small_numbers` failed: expected `add(1,2)` to return 3, but got 0.”*
   * *“Test `test_user_service` failed: calling `UserService.create_user` raised an exception 'Missing database connection'. Likely need to initialize DB connection.”*
     These summaries (or even the raw traceback and assertion messages) are provided to the Diffusion Generator for the next iteration. The model can be prompted with something like: *“Fix the code so that this test passes…”* followed by the failure details. This directs the model’s attention to the specific requirement it missed.
5. **Iterate:** The generator produces a new version of the code attempting to fix the identified issues. The updated code is again run against the tests. This cycle repeats until no tests fail.
6. **Refactor (if needed):** Once all tests pass (green), the system could optionally do a *refactoring* pass – cleaning up the code without changing functionality. This could be another application of the generator (prompted to “improve code style and refactor while keeping tests green”). However, refactoring is optional; the primary goal is correctness as verified by tests.

One important aspect is handling the **different levels of tests**:

* **Unit tests** focus on small units of code. Failing unit tests pinpoint issues in specific functions or classes. The feedback loop can often localize the problem to a particular function implementation, which the generator can then target for changes.
* **Integration tests** involve multiple components. Failures here might be due to misunderstandings between modules (e.g., function `X` returns a value that module `Y` doesn’t know how to handle). The system might need to adjust code in more than one place or adjust an interface contract. This is where the Coherence manager (discussed later) helps ensure that if, say, module `X` was expecting a string but `Y` provided a number, we correct that inconsistency.
* **System tests** (end-to-end) verify the whole system’s behavior. Failures here might be high-level (like a final output is incorrect). The cause could be anywhere in the flow of the program. The feedback loop in this case might require running additional diagnostics or breaking down the problem (perhaps writing temporary unit tests on the fly to narrow down the issue, or leveraging logging from the system).

The tight TDD loop ensures **the tests guide the code generation**. This not only results in code that is correct by construction (once it passes all tests), but also often leads to clearer, more requirement-focused code (since the AI is essentially trying to satisfy explicit examples and conditions). This addresses a common criticism of AI-generated code – that it might be syntactically correct but not actually fulfill the user’s intent. Here, the intent is encoded in the tests, and passing them is non-negotiable.

To illustrate the feedback loop, consider a simple example:

* We have a test for a function `add(x, y)`:

  ```python
  def test_add():
      assert add(1, 2) == 3
  ```

  Initially, our code generator produces a stub implementation:

  ```python
  def add(x, y):
      return 0
  ```

  Running the test yields a failure: *AssertionError: expected 3 but got 0*. The system captures this and forms feedback: *“Function `add` returned 0 for inputs (1,2) but expected 3.”* The generator then refines the code, possibly changing the return to `x + y`. Now the code is:

  ```python
  def add(x, y):
      return x + y
  ```

  The tests are run again; this time `test_add` passes (assuming no other hidden issues). The loop ends for this function. In a more complex scenario, say a second test `test_add_negative` expected `add(-1, -2) == -3`, if that also passes, great; if not, further refinement would occur.

This example is trivial, but it demonstrates the cycle. For a broader system, the same principle extends: generate code for all parts, run all tests, then iteratively fix whichever tests are failing. Notably, this approach can catch misunderstandings early. If a function name or expected behavior is misinterpreted by the model, a failing test will immediately point it out, and the model can correct course. This is essentially *self-correcting*. Indeed, recent work like **OpenCodeInterpreter** shows that integrating code execution feedback in the loop allows AI models to achieve much higher correctness, nearly matching GPT-4’s performance in coding challenges by fixing their mistakes iteratively.

**Implementation of Test Runner & Feedback:** Below, we present a simplified implementation of the test execution and feedback mechanism in Python. We simulate running tests by dynamically executing test code on the generated code and capturing exceptions:

```python
import types
import traceback

class TestRunner:
    def __init__(self, test_code_str):
        # test_code_str: string containing the test definitions (e.g., functions or pytest style).
        self.test_code_str = test_code_str
        # Compile the test code string into a code object
        self.test_module = types.ModuleType("dynamic_tests")
        exec(test_code_str, self.test_module.__dict__)
    
    def run_tests(self, impl_module):
        """
        Run tests in self.test_module on the given implementation module (impl_module).
        impl_module can be a ModuleType or dict containing the implementation to test.
        Returns a list of failure messages (empty if all passed).
        """
        failures = []
        # Iterate through attributes of the test module to find test functions
        for attr_name in dir(self.test_module):
            if attr_name.startswith("test_"):
                test_func = getattr(self.test_module, attr_name)
                try:
                    # Run the test function in an environment where it can access impl_module's symbols
                    # We'll temporarily update the globals of the test function to include the implementation.
                    test_globals = self.test_module.__dict__.copy()
                    if isinstance(impl_module, types.ModuleType):
                        # import all symbols from impl_module into test env
                        for name, val in impl_module.__dict__.items():
                            test_globals[name] = val
                    elif isinstance(impl_module, dict):
                        test_globals.update(impl_module)
                    # Execute test function
                    exec(test_func.__code__, test_globals)
                except Exception as e:
                    tb = traceback.format_exc()
                    failures.append(f"Test {attr_name} failed: {str(e)}\n{tb.splitlines()[-1]}")
        return failures

# Example usage:
# Define a simple test and an initial implementation for demonstration
test_code = """
def test_add():
    assert add(1, 2) == 3
"""
impl_code_v1 = "def add(x, y):\n    return 0"

# Create test runner and an implementation module
runner = TestRunner(test_code)
impl_module_v1 = types.ModuleType("impl_v1")
exec(impl_code_v1, impl_module_v1.__dict__)
failures = runner.run_tests(impl_module_v1)
print("Failures:", failures)
# Based on the failure, refine the code (simulate by hand here)
impl_code_v2 = "def add(x, y):\n    return x + y"
impl_module_v2 = types.ModuleType("impl_v2")
exec(impl_code_v2, impl_module_v2.__dict__)
failures2 = runner.run_tests(impl_module_v2)
print("Failures after refinement:", failures2)
```

In this code, `TestRunner` takes a string of test code, executes it in a fresh module (so we have test functions defined). The `run_tests` method takes an implementation (either a module or a dict of functions) and runs each test function. We ensure the implementation’s functions (like `add`) are available to the test by injecting them into the test’s namespace. If an assertion or error occurs, we catch it and record a message, including the exception message and last line of the traceback (which typically shows the assertion or error location).

In the example usage, we define a simple test expecting `add(1,2)==3`. We run it against an implementation `add(x,y): return 0`, capturing the failure. We then simulate a refinement by changing the implementation to `return x+y` and run tests again, now seeing no failures. In a full system, the refinement from v1 to v2 would be done by the DiffusionCodeGenerator using the feedback from the first failure.

For real-world usage, one might integrate with `unittest.TestLoader` or `pytest` to run tests more robustly, but the above approach demonstrates the concept in a self-contained way. The list of `failures` can be fed into the feedback analyzer to generate human-readable hints for the generator (or even directly provided to the model).

By continuously cycling through generation → test → feedback, the system effectively **uses tests as a reward signal** in a reinforcement learning sense – passing tests is the goal, and failing tests provide direct error signals to correct the course. This automated TDD loop stops when the code satisfies all tests, meaning the code meets all specified requirements.

## Modularity and Multi-File Support

Real software projects consist of multiple modules, packages, or even separate services. Our refinement system is built to handle **modular code and various architectures**:

* **Single repository, multiple files (Monolithic application):** The codebase is composed of many files (modules). The system keeps track of all files and their contents. When generating or refining code, it may generate code for multiple files or focus on one file at a time depending on where the tests are failing. For example, if tests fail in `moduleA` and `moduleB`, the generator might produce changes in both modules in one iteration. To manage this, the input to the generator can include multiple file contexts, or we can run separate generation passes per file with coordination. The Coherence manager (next section) ensures that cross-file references remain valid.
* **Microservices or distributed systems:** In a microservices architecture, different components might be in different languages or processes. Our system can tackle one service at a time: each service has its own tests (including possibly integration tests that use stubbed or real versions of other services). The refinement loop can be executed for each service’s code in turn. For integration tests that span services (for instance, a system test that calls a REST API of service A which in turn uses service B), a failure might indicate an issue in either service A or B. The feedback analyzer would need to identify which component likely caused the failure (perhaps by analyzing error messages or logs). Then the system can switch context to that service’s code and refine it. This requires a bit of orchestration: essentially treating each service as a separate project but linking their test feedback.
* **Hierarchical refinement:** One strategy for modular refinement is hierarchical: first ensure all **unit tests** in each module pass (refine each module in isolation if possible), then run **integration tests** that involve multiple modules. When an integration test fails, it might require coordinated changes. The system could then do a joint refinement considering the involved modules together. Finally, run system-level tests. This approach of staged refinement (unit-level then integration-level) can reduce the search complexity by focusing on smaller scopes first.
* **Shared interface contracts:** For multiple modules to work together, they must agree on function signatures, data schemas, etc. Our system maintains an internal representation of such contracts. For instance, if module X expects a function `foo(arg: int) -> str` to exist in module Y, and tests cover this, the coherence layer will ensure module Y indeed has `foo` with that signature and returns a string. If the generator in module Y produced a different signature or return type, the coherence check would flag it and adjust it. In effect, the system treats the interface as a fixed contract (or if the contract itself is not fixed, the system at least knows that both sides must match).
* **Context sharing:** A challenge in multi-file generation is providing enough context from other files. Our system can use a retrieval or context selection mechanism to feed relevant pieces of code into the generator. For example, if refining module B which calls module A, it’s useful to show the generator what module A’s API looks like (function names, expected behavior). This could be done by inserting module A’s header or docstring into the prompt for module B’s generation. In the diffusion model setting, we could concatenate context representations or use cross-attention between embeddings of related modules.

To demonstrate how the system might manage multiple files, consider a simple two-module scenario with an integration test:

* `math_utils.py` – supposed to have a function `divide(a, b)` that divides two numbers.
* `stats.py` – supposed to use `math_utils.divide` to compute an average of two numbers.
* Tests:

  * `test_divide`: checks `divide(6,2) == 3` and perhaps `divide(5,0)` raises an appropriate exception.
  * `test_average`: checks `average(6, 2) == 4` (which internally calls divide).
  * Integration test might call `average` which uses `divide` and ensure no errors propagate.

If `divide` is incorrectly implemented (say it returns floor division) or if `average` doesn’t handle exceptions from `divide`, tests will fail. The refinement process might catch the unit test failure in `divide` and fix it to do true division. Then integration test might fail if we didn’t handle division by zero in `average`. The next iteration, seeing an error (maybe a ZeroDivisionError) in `average`, would adjust `average` to catch that (or delegate to `divide` to handle it gracefully).

Our system would coordinate this by:

* Running all tests; suppose `test_divide` and `test_average` fail.
* Feedback: `test_divide` failure indicates `divide` logic issue; `test_average` failure might indicate either propagation of the same issue or a separate one.
* The generator could be invoked twice (once on each file) or once on both files combined. A simple approach is sequential: fix `math_utils.divide` first (unit test feedback), then run tests again, then fix `stats.average`.
* Alternatively, a more advanced generator could take both failure feedbacks and output code fixes for both files at once. Using a multi-output approach would require clearly delimiting which file is being edited. This can be done by including file names in the prompt and asking the model to output a diff or code block per file.

**Coordination of multi-file edits** is a complex task, but our design supports it by maintaining an in-memory representation of the entire project. For instance, we could represent the project as a dictionary `{filename: AST}`. The generator might actually work on this unified representation (e.g., generating code at the AST level and then we serialize each file out). An AST-level generator could directly modify nodes in different modules (ensuring, for example, if a function call in one module is mismatched, it either changes the call or the callee’s definition to reconcile them).

Another aspect is **large context handling**. For big projects, we cannot feed all code into the model at once (context length limits). Instead, we rely on the Coherence manager to extract just the necessary interface info. For example, if focusing on function `foo` in module X, we don’t need the entire source of module Y, only that module Y has `bar` that `foo` calls, etc. So, the system might generate a summary like “ModuleY.bar expects a string and returns an int” to include in the context for refining module X.

In summary, the system treats the codebase holistically but applies changes in a targeted way, guided by tests. This is akin to how a developer would work on a large codebase: run the test suite, see failures in specific components, and then jump into those components to fix them, while keeping in mind the overall design. By automating this, our system can handle broad architectures systematically. The use of a shared representation (like a combined AST or symbol table) for the entire project is crucial to maintain consistency – which we elaborate on next.

## Coherence Through Shared Representations (AST and Contracts)

To **maintain algorithmic coherence**, all parts of the system rely on shared representations of code structure and intended behavior. This prevents the generator from introducing inconsistencies and helps the feedback loop pinpoint issues accurately. The primary structures we use are:

* **Abstract Syntax Trees (ASTs):** Rather than treating code as free-form text, we parse it into an AST for analysis. The Coherence manager uses Python’s `ast` module (or equivalent for other languages) to get a tree representation of each file. This enables several things:

  * We can easily find definitions of classes and functions, and their signatures (names of parameters, etc.).
  * We can detect if the generated code is syntactically invalid immediately (before even running tests). If the AST parser fails, we know the model produced broken syntax; we can then prompt the model to fix syntax or even auto-correct minor issues (like adding a missing colon).
  * We can modify the AST directly for certain adjustments. For instance, if a test expects a function that wasn’t generated at all, we can insert an AST node for a stub of that function (so that at least tests don’t crash with `NameError`). The generator will later fill in the stub’s body.
  * By comparing ASTs between iterations, we can see what changed and possibly correlate that with test outcomes (useful for the self-optimizer).
* **Interface contracts:** We explicitly model the expected interfaces. An interface contract could be as simple as a function signature with a docstring, or a more complex schema (for a microservice, it could be an API specification). The tests essentially define these contracts implicitly (they call functions with certain arguments and expect certain types/behaviors). We extract that info. For example:

  * If a test calls `result = search("hello")` and expects `result` to be a list of strings, we record that `search(str) -> List[str]` is a contract.
  * If an integration test posts JSON to a web endpoint and expects a certain JSON response, that’s an interface contract between services.

  The coherence layer uses these contracts to verify the code: ensure that any function `search` defined in the code returns a list of strings. This might involve static analysis or even runtime type checking if type hints are provided. If the model proposes a different type (maybe it returns a single string), we catch it.
* **Semantic embeddings:** In more advanced usage, we could use vector embeddings to represent the semantics of code or requirements. For example, embed the description of a function from its docstring and embed the code of the function, and ensure they are aligned (there are research works on using embeddings to catch mismatches). In our system, the diffusion model itself likely operates in an embedding space for code, so we ensure that the same embedding is shared across components. For instance, the test spec encoder produces an embedding that the denoiser uses; similarly, we could use that embedding in the coherence checker to compare with some known good representation.

In practice, the Coherence manager performs checks after each generation (and before running tests, to catch issues early) and possibly also after each code execution:

* **Static checks (pre-execution):** Using AST and contracts, verify that the code has all the required definitions with correct signatures. If anything is missing or mismatched, either automatically fix it or generate a targeted feedback for the model to fix it. For example, *“Error: function `divide` called in tests but not implemented. Added a stub. Please implement it.”* This prevents trivial failures that don’t teach the model anything new (e.g., forgetting to implement a required function – we can just tell the model to do it).
* **Post-execution checks:** Sometimes tests might pass even if the code is semantically off with respect to some spec (e.g., the code returns the correct values but maybe in the wrong type, which the test didn’t catch because Python is dynamic). The coherence layer can enforce stricter conditions (like type hints or performance constraints) that go beyond given tests. If, for instance, a function is expected (by design) to run in O(n log n) but the model came up with an O(n^2) solution that barely passes the tests for small inputs, a coherence rule could flag it (though this ventures into non-test specs; perhaps out of pure TDD scope, but possible if such constraints are provided).

**Using AST for transformation:** If the generator outputs code as text, we convert it to AST for verification. We can also feed AST back into the generator: one way is to serialize the AST in a normalized form (pretty-printed code or a structured format) that the generator can consume for the next iteration. Alternatively, the generator could directly operate on ASTs if it’s trained that way (some research has looked into models generating ASTs node by node). In our design, we assume the generator works with source code text, but the AST is a tool for us (the system) to check and guide the generator.

Here’s a small snippet showing how we might use Python’s AST to enforce coherence in a simple case, such as ensuring all functions that tests expect are present:

```python
import ast

class CoherenceManager:
    def __init__(self, test_code_str):
        # Analyze test code AST to extract expected interfaces
        self.expected_functions = {}  # name -> expected arg count or signature
        test_tree = ast.parse(test_code_str)
        for node in ast.walk(test_tree):
            # Look for function calls in tests
            if isinstance(node, ast.Call):
                if isinstance(node.func, ast.Name):
                    func_name = node.func.id
                    # Record expected number of args (for simplicity)
                    self.expected_functions.setdefault(func_name, set()).add(len(node.args))
                elif isinstance(node.func, ast.Attribute):
                    # e.g., object.method(), we could handle methods similarly
                    func_name = node.func.attr  # method name
                    self.expected_functions.setdefault(func_name, set()).add(len(node.args))
    
    def check_and_adjust(self, code_str):
        """
        Parse the code_str, check for required functions from tests.
        If any expected function is missing, add a stub implementation.
        Return possibly adjusted code_str and a report of changes.
        """
        code_tree = ast.parse(code_str)
        defined_funcs = {node.name for node in ast.walk(code_tree) if isinstance(node, ast.FunctionDef)}
        modifications = []
        # For each expected function from tests, ensure it's defined
        for func_name, arg_counts in self.expected_functions.items():
            if func_name not in defined_funcs:
                # Add a stub for the missing function
                arg_list = ",".join(f"arg{i}" for i in range(max(arg_counts)))  # assume max arg count as needed params
                stub = f"\ndef {func_name}({arg_list}):\n    raise NotImplementedError('Stub for {func_name}')\n"
                code_str += stub
                modifications.append(f"Added stub for missing function '{func_name}'.")
        return code_str, modifications

# Example coherence check:
test_code = "def test_foo():\n    assert foo(1,2) == 3"
partial_impl = "def bar(x, y):\n    return x+y"
cm = CoherenceManager(test_code)
adjusted_code, mods = cm.check_and_adjust(partial_impl)
print("Modifications:", mods)
print("Adjusted code:", adjusted_code)
```

In this snippet, `CoherenceManager` inspects the tests to find any function calls (here, it finds that `foo` is called with 2 arguments). When given an implementation that only defines `bar`, it realizes `foo` is missing and appends a stub definition for `foo(x,y)` that simply raises `NotImplementedError`. This ensures that when we run the tests, we won’t get a `NameError`; instead, the test will fail (because of the NotImplementedError or because the assertion is not met), but at least the structure is there. The generator can then focus on implementing `foo` properly in the next iteration, guided by the test failure message from the stub (which might say "NotImplementedError: Stub for foo").

This approach of seeding stubs is very useful for broad systems where one part of the code may depend on another that hasn’t been generated yet. It’s a bit like scaffolding. Humans do this in TDD all the time: write a function signature with a dummy body just to satisfy the compiler or test runner, then fill it in.

**Shared AST and symbol table:** The coherence manager can also maintain a symbol table of global definitions across the project. This helps to ensure, for example, if the code generator decides to rename a function or introduce a new one, we catch discrepancies. If module A expects `functionX` but module B renamed it to `functionY`, the tests for A will fail, but the coherence check could catch it even before running tests by noticing `functionX` interface is missing.

The net effect of these coherence measures is that all components (generator, tests, codebase) are synchronized in terms of understanding the code’s structure. This prevents a lot of random thrashing where the model might otherwise introduce new errors while fixing old ones. By preserving interfaces and overall design, we ensure the system is solving the intended problem. Indeed, approaches like **ProCoder** (2024) have shown the importance of aligning generated code with project-specific context and interfaces, by using compiler feedback to iteratively fix mismatches. In our system, tests and AST analyses play a similar role to compiler feedback, ensuring the generated code fits the project context and satisfies all contracts.

## Recursive Self-Optimization Mechanism

While the core feedback loop described above will eventually yield a working solution for a given test suite, the **efficiency and reliability** of the system can be further improved by a recursive self-optimization mechanism. The idea is that the system not only fixes the code, but also *learns to better fix code* (and even to write better initial code) over time, across many problem instances or projects.

Key aspects of the self-optimizer component include:

* **Failure Pattern Logging:** Each time a test fails and is subsequently fixed by the system, we log the nature of the failure and the fix applied. Over time, a knowledge base builds up. For example, the system might notice that “many times, when a function returns 0 instead of the correct result, the fix was to use the proper formula or calculation.” Or “whenever a KeyError happens due to missing dict keys, the fix is to check before accessing or use `.get()` with a default.”
* **Prompt Adaptation:** Using the logged patterns, the system can adapt the prompts given to the Diffusion Generator. Suppose the log shows that often the model forgets to handle edge cases (like division by zero, empty inputs, etc.) until tests catch it. The prompt template can be adjusted to always remind the model: e.g., *“Remember to consider edge cases such as division by zero or empty inputs.”* This means in future refinement cycles, the model is less likely to make those mistakes in the first place. This adaptation can happen offline (between runs) or online (during a run if it sees repeated similar failures).
* **Heuristic Rules and Constraints:** The self-optimizer can also derive heuristic rules. For instance, “if a function’s name implies a boolean return (e.g., `is_valid`), ensure the return value is a boolean.” If a test failure indicates a boolean was expected (like an assertion `assert is_valid(data) is True` failed because `is_valid` returned a non-bool), the system could automatically enforce that rule next time. These rules can be fed into the coherence checker to preempt certain errors or into the generator prompt as guidelines.
* **Model Fine-Tuning:** If the same codebase is refined multiple times (or similar patterns appear across different codebases), one could fine-tune the underlying model on the successful code or on the sequence of edits made. However, continuously training the model in production may be expensive. A simpler alternative is to maintain a small meta-model or classifier that looks at a proposed solution and predicts if it’s likely to pass tests or not, based on past experience, then use that to steer generation (this is advanced and somewhat experimental).
* **Hyperparameter adjustment:** The diffusion generator might have parameters like number of refinement steps, or the diversity of sampling. The self-optimizer can adjust these per iteration. For example, if the model has stalled (not improving on a particular failing test for several iterations), the system could increase the number of diffusion steps or try a different sampling strategy (broaden search). Conversely, if the model is overshooting (introducing new errors when fixing one), perhaps take smaller steps or incorporate more of the previous correct code unchanged.
* **Selective Regression Testing:** As the system learns, it can introduce additional tests on the fly for known tricky cases. For instance, if historically a certain edge-case often breaks, even if the user didn’t write a test for it, the system might generate one and check it. This is akin to the system testing itself. (This borders on test generation, which is beyond strict TDD, but it’s a form of self-optimizing behavior to improve robustness.)
* **Refinement of the Refinement:** The self-optimizer can even adjust how it parses feedback. If it finds that the way it summarized an error for the model was ineffective, it could try different wording. For example, an error `AssertionError: expected 10, got 8` could be paraphrased as “The result is 2 less than expected; maybe an off-by-one or missing addition?” If the model responds better to one style of feedback, the system will use that style more.

To implement a basic self-optimizer, we can use the logging library to record events and outcomes, and then simple logic to adjust the prompt. Below is a conceptual snippet:

```python
import logging

logging.basicConfig(filename='refinement.log', level=logging.INFO)
class SelfOptimizer:
    def __init__(self):
        self.previous_failures = []  # store tuples of (failure_message, fix_summary)
        self.tweak_applied = False
    
    def log_failure_and_fix(self, failure_msg, fix_desc):
        logging.info(f"FAILURE: {failure_msg} | FIX: {fix_desc}")
        self.previous_failures.append((failure_msg, fix_desc))
    
    def update_generator_prompt(self, base_prompt):
        # Analyze failures and add hints to prompt if patterns found
        hints = []
        for failure, fix in self.previous_failures:
            if "off by one" in failure.lower() or "off-by-one" in fix.lower():
                hints.append("Check off-by-one errors.")
            if "exception" in failure.lower():
                hints.append("Handle exceptions where applicable.")
        # Remove duplicate hints and append to prompt
        if hints:
            unique_hints = sorted(set(hints))
            hint_text = "Important considerations: " + "; ".join(unique_hints) + ".\n"
            self.tweak_applied = True
            return hint_text + base_prompt
        else:
            return base_prompt

# Usage of SelfOptimizer in a cycle (pseudo-code context):
# Suppose we had a failure and we know how we fixed it:
failure_message = "Test test_divide_by_zero failed: ZeroDivisionError"
fix_description = "Added check for divisor == 0 in divide()"
optimizer = SelfOptimizer()
optimizer.log_failure_and_fix(failure_message, fix_description)
# Next iteration, before generating code, adjust prompt:
base_prompt = "Implement function divide(a,b) that divides a by b."
new_prompt = optimizer.update_generator_prompt(base_prompt)
print("Adjusted Prompt:\n", new_prompt)
```

If the `previous_failures` list contains something suggesting an off-by-one issue or an exception handling issue, we prepend a hint to the base prompt. In this case, the failure was a ZeroDivisionError, so `hints` would include “Handle exceptions where applicable.” The new prompt might become:

```
Important considerations: Handle exceptions where applicable.
Implement function divide(a,b) that divides a by b.
```

This prompt is more instructive to the model than the base prompt, nudging it to include exception handling (like checking for b==0).

Over many iterations and projects, the log file `refinement.log` could be mined for more complex insights, or even used to train a small decision tree or ML model that given a failure message suggests a type of fix. For example, it may learn that whenever there’s an assertion about floating point precision, the fix is to use an approximate comparison or adjust the formula.

An additional form of self-optimization is **A/B testing different generation strategies**. The system can occasionally try a different approach (say, a different order of tackling tests, or a different sampling temperature for the model) and see if it results in fewer iterations. If it does, the system can adopt that as the default.

Finally, the self-optimizer ensures the system remains robust as it scales to more complex tasks. It’s what allows the system to not just solve one problem, but improve in its ability to solve future problems. This addresses a common issue in AI code generation: sometimes models can solve simple tests but struggle with complex scenarios or multiple at once. By learning from each scenario, our system continually narrows that gap.

## CPU and GPU Compatibility

The implementation is designed to be **hardware-agnostic** with support for both CPU and GPU execution:

* We use PyTorch (which by default allows easy switching between CPU and GPU via `.to(device)` as shown in our code). The `DiffusionCodeGenerator` in our implementation accepts a `device` parameter and ensures all model components and tensors are on that device. This means if a GPU is available (say `cuda:0`), we can instantiate the generator on GPU and enjoy accelerated matrix computations during code refinement. If no GPU is available, the system runs on CPU; for smaller code generation tasks or during the initial development of the system, CPU might be sufficient (albeit slower).
* **CPU-friendly design:** We avoid any operations that are inherently GPU-only. For example, our use of the `torch.nn.Transformer` and other layers can run on CPU (just more slowly). When generating code, the batch sizes are usually small (often we generate one solution at a time, or a handful in parallel), so running on CPU is feasible especially for short code snippets or when doing unit-test-level refinement. This is important for developers who might run the refinement system on their local machines which might not have a powerful GPU.
* **GPU utilization:** For heavy workloads, such as refining a large project or using a very large model (like a 6B-parameter Transformer), a GPU (or multiple GPUs) becomes valuable. Our system can take advantage of that by moving models to GPU, and also by parallelizing certain steps. For instance, running tests can sometimes be done in parallel (especially unit tests that don’t interfere with each other); we could spawn separate processes or threads for that. If tests themselves are CPU-bound, having a multi-core CPU or multiple CPUs helps – the system should be able to utilize standard test runners that can do parallel testing (like pytest’s `-n` option for xdist).
* **Scaling with GPUs:** If multiple GPUs are present, one could imagine using data parallelism for generation (generate multiple candidate programs in parallel on different devices) or model parallelism for very large models. Our design, being modular, can be extended to such configurations. For example, one could run two instances of the Diffusion Generator on two GPUs, each proposing fixes, and then use the best one (or somehow merge their ideas). This isn’t in the basic implementation but is an extension path.
* **Development vs Production modes:** We might have a configuration where in “dev mode” (on a laptop, no GPU) the system uses a small model (perhaps a distilled version of the diffusion model, or fewer diffusion steps to save time) and maybe even limits to unit tests, whereas in “production mode” (on a server with GPU), it uses the full model capacity and runs all tests including heavy integration tests. Both modes use the same codebase; it’s just a matter of configuration. We ensure to test on CPU to catch any platform-specific issues (e.g., some PyTorch operations might have nondeterministic behavior on GPU that we should be aware of, especially if generating code needs to be deterministic for reproducibility of debugging).
* **Memory considerations:** Large models can consume a lot of memory on GPU. We should allow the user to configure the model size (perhaps load a smaller model if GPU memory is limited). Additionally, our multi-file context approach should be mindful of not blowing up memory with extremely large ASTs or embeddings. We likely will truncate or prioritize context to fit within model limits.
* **GPU for testing:** Interesting to note, if the software under test has parts that can use GPU (e.g., if it includes some AI or numeric computations), the tests might implicitly use GPUs too. Our system should not interfere with that – it should let the code use whatever it needs. For example, if the project is a deep learning library itself and one integration test trains a small model on GPU, our system should allow that to happen if a GPU is present. This just means our container or environment needs to have the right drivers and the test runner should be able to access the device. Typically, this is not an issue unless the act of running tests on GPU slows down our refinement loop (which it could; in such cases, one might instruct the test runner to use CPU for deterministic and possibly simpler behavior during the refinement cycle, unless GPU is needed).
* **Continuous integration compatibility:** Since the system can run on CPU, it can be integrated into CI pipelines (where runners often don’t have GPUs by default). This means one could set up an automated pipeline where upon each commit, this system tries to generate or refine code to satisfy new tests (though in a real scenario, generation would be done by a dev’s machine rather than CI due to trust issues; but it’s conceivable to have an AI assistant running in CI verifying things).

In summary, **compatibility with CPU/GPU** ensures that the refinement process is accessible and flexible. We demonstrate below how one might initialize the system for different devices:

```python
# Selecting device for the generator
import torch
device = torch.device("cuda:0") if torch.cuda.is_available() else torch.device("cpu")
generator = DiffusionCodeGenerator(device=device)
print("Using device:", device)
```

When running on a GPU, this will output `Using device: cuda:0`, and all model weights and computations happen on the GPU. On a CPU-only environment, it will be `Using device: cpu`. All other components of the system (test runner, coherence checks) are pure Python code and will run on CPU in any case (which is fine; they are not the bottleneck typically).

## Implementation of Core Components

Bringing together the above pieces, we present a modular implementation sketch in Python for the core components: the diffusion refinement engine, the feedback loop orchestrator (integrating test running and generator), the coherence manager, and the self-optimizer. The code is organized into classes for clarity and extensibility. This implementation is not fully fleshed out with a trained model but provides the scaffolding into which a real model can be plugged.

This `CodeRefinementSystem` class ties everything together. Let’s walk through it:

* It initializes with the test code (here as a string). In a real scenario, you might load test files from disk.
* It creates a `TestRunner` for executing tests, a `CoherenceManager` to enforce expected interfaces, the `DiffusionCodeGenerator` (currently using CPU and our dummy model), and a `SelfOptimizer`.
* The codebase is represented as a dictionary mapping filenames to code. For simplicity, we treat everything as one file "solution.py" here. If you had multiple files, you could extend this to multiple entries and adjust how tests are run (perhaps by module import path).
* The `refine_cycle` method runs iterations up to `max_iterations`. In each iteration:

  1. It calls `coherence_manager.enforce` on each file’s code to add any needed stubs for missing functions (ensuring tests won’t fail due to missing definitions). This also updates the internal codebase if changes were made.
  2. It then tries to execute the code and run tests. We first `exec` the code into a `solution_module`. If there’s a top-level error during import (like a syntax error that wasn’t caught by AST parse or an error in a global initialization), we catch that as a failure. Otherwise, we call `test_runner.run_tests` with this module to get the list of failing tests.
  3. If `failures` list is empty, all tests passed and we break out of the loop.
  4. If there are failures, we log them and print them. The feedback text is prepared (just concatenating failure messages; one could format it nicer or prioritize).
  5. We inform the `SelfOptimizer` of these failures via `log_failure_and_fix`. In this simple code, we put a placeholder for fix description since the fix will happen after generation. In a more advanced version, we might generate a fix and then call `log_failure_and_fix(failure, description_of_fix)`.
  6. For each file in the codebase, we construct a prompt that includes the current code and the entire test suite (and perhaps the failures). Here we did a simplistic concatenation: current code, then tests, then a request to fix issues. We then call the generator’s `generate_code`, passing the test spec and current code along with the feedback. It returns refined code, which we put back into the codebase. (Our `generate_code` already was designed to incorporate feedback internally.)
* The loop then repeats with the new code.

In the example usage at the bottom, we provided a test for `add` and run the refinement. Given our dummy generator, it’s not actually intelligent, so it likely won’t magically produce correct code. But if we had a real model, we’d expect after one or two iterations the final code is `def add(1,2): return x+y` or similar. We print the final code for inspection.

We also use Python’s `logging` to record events. For instance, we log when stubs are added, when tests fail, and when code is updated. These logs (in `refinement.log`) can later be analyzed by the self-optimizer or a developer to see what happened at each step.

**Extensibility:** The above code is modular. For adding support for multiple files, we’d extend the codebase to have multiple entries and adjust the coherence checks to ensure cross-file references (maybe by combining all code for AST analysis or by linking CoherenceManagers for each test file if tests are separate per module). For supporting other languages, one could generalize `TestRunner` and `CoherenceManager` – perhaps by defining abstract base classes and then implementing Python-specific, Java-specific, etc., subclasses. The DiffusionCodeGenerator could also be abstracted if using different model backends for different languages.

Finally, note that we did not implement actual Docker or CLI in this snippet, but we describe them next.

## Example Workflow

Let’s run through a concrete example using the implemented system (in a hypothetical scenario where the generator is smarter than our stub). Consider a scenario:

**Problem:** Implement a function `factorial(n)` that returns the factorial of n, and a function `choose(n, k)` that returns the binomial coefficient “n choose k”. We have the following tests in `test_math.py`:

```python
def test_factorial_base():
    assert factorial(0) == 1
    assert factorial(1) == 1

def test_factorial_recursive():
    assert factorial(5) == 120

def test_choose_basic():
    assert choose(5, 2) == 10  # 5 choose 2 = 10
    assert choose(5, 5) == 1   # n choose n = 1

def test_choose_relation():
    # Using relation: choose(n, k) = factorial(n) / (factorial(k)*factorial(n-k))
    import math
    for n in range(6):
        for k in range(n+1):
            assert choose(n, k) == math.comb(n, k)
```

**Iteration 0 (Initialization):** The codebase is empty. The coherence manager sees that tests call `factorial` (with 1 arg) and `choose` (with 2 args). It adds stubs:

```python
def factorial(arg0):
    raise NotImplementedError('Stub for factorial')

def choose(arg0, arg1):
    raise NotImplementedError('Stub for choose')
```

No code logic yet.

**Iteration 1:** Tests run:

* `test_factorial_base` fails because calling `factorial(0)` raises NotImplementedError (from stub).
* Similarly, `test_choose_basic` fails with NotImplementedError for `choose`.
  We gather failures like “factorial stub called” and “choose stub called.” The generator gets these failures plus the tests. It generates an implementation. Perhaps it knows the math, so it outputs:

```python
def factorial(n):
    if n <= 1:
        return 1
    else:
        return n * factorial(n-1)

def choose(n, k):
    # Use formula n! / (k! * (n-k)!)
    return factorial(n) // (factorial(k) * factorial(n-k))
```

(This would be a correct implementation.)

The code is updated with this.

**Iteration 2:** Run tests on the new code:

* `test_factorial_base` passes (0! = 1, 1! = 1).
* `test_factorial_recursive` passes (5! = 120).
* `test_choose_basic` passes (5 choose 2 = 10, 5 choose 5 = 1).
* `test_choose_relation` – uses Python’s `math.comb` to verify choose. All those should pass too with the formula given.
  If all tests pass, we’re done in 2 iterations.

If the generator was less exact, maybe it did something slightly off, the tests would point it out. For instance, if it returned a float or used `/` (true division) instead of `//` for choose, the test expecting int might fail. The feedback would say e.g. “expected 10 (int) got 10.0 (float)”. The next iteration the model would likely adjust the division to integer (as we did manually by using `//`).

**Output:** The final code is both functions correctly implemented. The system logs show the stub insertion, then the changes made by the model, etc. The developer can then inspect the final code or integrate it into the codebase.

This workflow demonstrates how, starting from just tests, the system arrived at a correct solution iteratively. It effectively **automated TDD** for those functions. The final code is guaranteed by tests to meet the requirements, and the developer didn’t have to write the code, just the tests.

## CLI and Usage Interface

For ease of use, we provide a **command-line interface (CLI)** to run refinement cycles on a given project. A typical CLI tool (e.g., `refine.py`) might accept arguments for the project path, test directory, and output directory for generated code. It could be used like:

```bash
$ python refine.py --tests tests/ --src src/ --max-iter 5 --model large
```

Where:

* `--tests` points to the directory containing test files.
* `--src` is where to output the refined code (or where initial stubs are).
* `--max-iter` limits iterations (to avoid infinite loops in case of insolvable tests).
* `--model` might let user choose a model size or variant (e.g., “large” for a larger neural network if GPU available, or “small” for faster iteration).

The CLI would perform steps: load tests, initialize system, optionally load existing code (if any) as starting point, then run `refine_cycle`. After completion, it would write the resulting code files to the source directory.

Here’s a pseudocode snippet for the CLI (not fully fleshed out with arg parsing for brevity):

```python
if __name__ == "__main__":
    import argparse, os
    parser = argparse.ArgumentParser(description="Run diffusion-based code refinement.")
    parser.add_argument("--tests", required=True, help="Path to tests directory or file.")
    parser.add_argument("--src", required=True, help="Path to source code directory to refine.")
    parser.add_argument("--max-iter", type=int, default=10, help="Max refinement iterations.")
    parser.add_argument("--model", choices=["small", "large"], default="small", help="Model size/backbone to use.")
    args = parser.parse_args()

    # Read test files
    test_code_str = ""
    if os.path.isdir(args.tests):
        for fname in os.listdir(args.tests):
            if fname.endswith(".py"):
                test_code_str += open(os.path.join(args.tests, fname)).read() + "\n"
    else:
        test_code_str = open(args.tests).read()
    # Optionally, read initial source files if present (or else start with empty stubs)
    initial_codebase = {}
    if os.path.isdir(args.src):
        for fname in os.listdir(args.src):
            if fname.endswith(".py"):
                initial_codebase[fname] = open(os.path.join(args.src, fname)).read()
    else:
        print("Source path must be a directory.")
        exit(1)
    # Initialize system
    system = CodeRefinementSystem(test_code_str)
    system.codebase = initial_codebase if initial_codebase else system.codebase  # use loaded code or default stubs
    if args.model == "large":
        # (Pretend we load a larger model or set device to GPU)
        system.generator = DiffusionCodeGenerator(device=torch.device("cuda" if torch.cuda.is_available() else "cpu"))
    # Run refinement
    final_codebase = system.refine_cycle(max_iterations=args.max_iter)
    # Write out the refined code to src directory
    for fname, code in final_codebase.items():
        with open(os.path.join(args.src, fname), "w") as f:
            f.write(code)
    print("Refinement complete. See", args.src, "for updated code.")
```

This CLI would enable developers to easily apply the system to their own projects. They just point it to their tests, and it will produce implementations. During the run, the CLI can print iteration info and failures as we did in the `refine_cycle` method for transparency.

Additionally, we could integrate this with an interactive agent interface (like a chat where the system reports progress and maybe asks for guidance if needed, though ideally it’s fully automated). For now, the CLI is straightforward.

## Logging and Visualization

Tracking the refinement progress is crucial for both debugging the system and explaining its behavior to developers. We have integrated Python’s `logging` to record key events (iteration count, failures, fixes, etc.). This log can be output to console or saved to a file as configured. For better visualization, one could:

* **Display diffs between iterations:** After each refinement, show a unified diff of the code changes. This can be more insightful than seeing the whole file. For example, if iteration 3 fixed a specific line in a function, we can present that diff. This could be printed to console or even stored in a file per iteration (e.g., `diff_iter3.patch`).
* **Graphical interface:** The system could be wrapped in a simple GUI or notebook interface where each iteration’s results are shown. For instance, using a Jupyter notebook, one could visualize the AST or intermediate states. Given this is a deep research context, one might not build a full GUI, but the logs/diffs themselves can be visualized with existing tools.
* **Metrics tracking:** We can output metrics like “tests passed vs total” each iteration. E.g., *Iteration 2: 5/7 tests passed.* This trend should be non-decreasing. We could even plot it if we were running many iterations. Hooking into a tool like TensorBoard is possible: we could send the number of failing tests as a scalar metric at each iteration to TensorBoard for real-time monitoring.
* **Timing and performance logs:** Log how long each iteration takes (especially the test execution vs generation time). This helps identify bottlenecks.
* **Visualization of model confidence:** If our model can output some confidence or probability, we might log that too, though our diffusion model is generative and doesn’t give a single confidence score. But we could measure something like similarity of subsequent outputs to see if it’s converging.

The logging we implemented in `SelfOptimizer.log_failure_and_fix` and within the refinement loop will create a text history. The self-optimizer could later visualize common failure types (like a bar chart of how many times a certain kind of error occurred across projects) to direct future model improvements.

For demonstration, after running the refinement, one could inspect the log:

```bash
$ cat refinement.log
```

It might contain lines like:

```
Iteration 1: Added stubs to solution.py
Iteration 1: Test failures:
Test test_factorial_base failed: NotImplementedError ...
Test test_choose_basic failed: NotImplementedError ...
Iteration 1: Updated solution.py with new code.
Iteration 2: Test failures:
Test test_choose_relation failed: AssertionError expected 252 got 252.0
Iteration 2: Updated solution.py with new code.
All tests passed after 2 refinements.
```

This tells a story of what happened. A developer could use this to verify that the AI isn’t doing something completely off-track.

If we wanted to integrate visualization further, we might include an option to output each iteration’s code to a separate file (like `solution_iter1.py`, `solution_iter2.py`, etc.) so one can open and compare them. However, this could clutter the workspace; an alternative is to keep everything in memory and only present final code and maybe diffs.

## Extending to Other Languages and Environments

While our primary implementation and examples are in Python (which is convenient due to its introspection and dynamic execution capabilities), the design is intended to be **language-agnostic** with additional effort. To extend this system to other programming languages or environments, consider the following adaptations:

* **Language Model:** Replace the underlying generative model with one trained on the target language. For example, for Java one might use a code generation model specialized in Java syntax and libraries. PyTorch can still be used to host the model (it could be a Transformer that outputs Java code). The diffusion approach is equally applicable to any text-based code.
* **Test Execution:** Use appropriate tools to run tests. For Java, one could integrate JUnit or a build tool like Maven/Gradle to run the test suite and parse results (perhaps by generating an XML report and reading it). For JavaScript, use a testing framework like Mocha or Jest programmatically. The `TestRunner` class would be different for each ecosystem. It might invoke an external process (e.g., calling `mvn test` for Java) rather than executing in-process as we did for Python.
* **AST and Coherence:** Every language has its syntax and possibly an AST parser library (for instance, Java has libraries like JavaParser, or one could use ANTLR for many languages). The Coherence manager would need to parse test code and implementation code in that language to extract interfaces. For statically typed languages, this can be even richer (types can be leveraged heavily to ensure coherence). In those languages, the compiler itself provides a lot of coherence checking – e.g., if a function is called with wrong types, compilation fails, which is akin to a test failure. So the system could use compiler errors as feedback too.
* **Stubs and Scaffolding:** In languages like Java or C#, you must have class and method declarations in place to compile. The system would initially generate interfaces (perhaps from something like interface definitions or from test expectations). For instance, if a JUnit test calls `Calculator.add(2,2)`, the coherence manager would ensure a class `Calculator` with method `add(int,int)` exists, at least as a stub. This might involve generating a whole class if needed:

  ```java
  class Calculator {
      public static int add(int a, int b) {
          throw new UnsupportedOperationException("Stub");
      }
  }
  ```

  Then the refinement would fill in the method body.
* **Microservice endpoints:** If tests involve API calls (e.g., an HTTP request to a service), the system could incorporate contract definitions like OpenAPI specs as part of the context. Ensuring coherence might involve reading a YAML OpenAPI spec and confirming the generated code (like a Flask or Express app) has routes that match the spec.
* **Performance differences:** Running and spawning processes for compiled languages will be slower than Python’s in-memory test execution. The system might need to be tuned to minimize full recompilations. One trick is to only recompile the module that changed and then run tests for that module (but integration tests may require full build). Incremental compilation or using an interactive REPL for the language (if available) could help.
* **Self-optimization in other languages:** The patterns of errors will differ. For example, in C++ a common error might be memory leaks or segmentation faults. The self-optimizer could learn from address sanitizer outputs or valgrind logs to remind the model to manage memory. In Java, a common fix might be related to null-pointer exceptions.
* **Tool Integration:** We can integrate static analysis tools or linters for other languages as part of coherence. For instance, run ESLint on generated JavaScript code to catch issues early, or run a type checker for Python (mypy) to enforce type hints compliance.

The overall architecture remains the same: generator, test runner, coherence checker, feedback loop. Each of those needs a language-specific implementation. Our modular design facilitates plugging these in. One could abstract a base class `CodeGenerator`, `TestRunner`, etc., and have Python, Java, JS subclasses.

For demonstration, suppose we want to adapt to Java:

* Use a Java LLM (perhaps via an API if not available locally).
* Have `TestRunner` call `javac` and `java` to compile and run JUnit tests. Parse the output for failures.
* Coherence: perhaps pre-scan tests for any class/method references, create those classes or method signatures in a stub Java file. Use the Java compiler’s errors as additional feedback (e.g., if something still undefined or wrong types).
* Each iteration, update the .java files accordingly and re-run.

The concept of diffusion-based refinement still applies — we could treat the sequence of Java tokens similarly, or operate on bytecode (but that’s less intuitive; text is fine).

To conclude this section: the system is designed to be **clear and modular** so that adding support for a new language is a matter of swapping out components. The Python example serves as a template. As an exercise, one could implement a smaller subset (like just handling a single-file C program with some unit tests using `assert`) to confirm the approach generalizes. The tight integration of generation and testing is universally useful, regardless of language, as it ensures correctness drives the generation process.

## Conclusion

We have designed a comprehensive diffusion-based code refinement system aligned with TDD principles. Through iterative denoising of code and constant guidance from tests, the system can handle complex, multi-module software projects, producing correct and coherent implementations. We provided a modular architecture, implementation sketches in Python (using PyTorch for the core model), and an example workflow demonstrating how the system converges on a solution. Key advantages of this approach include:

* **High Reliability:** The code is verified by tests at each step, reducing the chance of subtle bugs. By the time the process finishes, we have high confidence in the code’s correctness (bounded by the quality of the tests).
* **Modularity:** The system naturally breaks a big problem into smaller ones (per test failure, per component), similar to how a human would iteratively address issues in a codebase. This makes it scalable to larger projects.
* **Learning Capability:** The recursive self-optimization means the more you use the system, the better it can become, potentially reducing the number of iterations needed for new tasks as it accumulates knowledge.
* **Extensibility:** New languages, different testing frameworks, or even different kinds of constraints (like formal specifications or performance tests) can be integrated due to the clear separation of concerns in the design.
* **Reproducibility:** With a deterministic approach to applying a pre-trained model and running tests, and optional Docker/Codespace environment specifications, results can be reproduced consistently across environments, which is important for collaborative development.

To fully realize this system, one would integrate a state-of-the-art code generative model (or even multiple models) and invest in robust parsing and execution sandboxes for target languages. The groundwork provided here demonstrates the feasibility and outlines how to implement each piece with best practices from recent research (like test-driven prompts, diffusion models for code, and execution feedback loops). This approach represents a step towards AI-assisted development where tests truly drive development, and the AI handles the heavy lifting of writing and refining code – ultimately accelerating the development cycle while maintaining (or even enhancing) code quality.
