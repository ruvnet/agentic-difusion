To align with your prototype emphasizing recursion, diffusion, and algorithmic coherence, I recommend using **Stable Diffusion** with the **AUTOMATIC1111 Web UI**. This implementation supports both CPU and GPU execution, allowing for flexible development and deployment workflows.

### üß† Why This Fits Your Prototype

* **Recursion (Self-Optimization):** The modular design allows for iterative refinement and integration of self-optimizing components.
* **Diffusion (Generative Refinement):** Stable Diffusion inherently utilizes diffusion processes to generate images from noise, aligning with your diffusion-based reasoning concept.
* **Algorithmic Coherence:** The shared architecture ensures consistent data representations across modules, facilitating coherent interactions between perception, planning, and reasoning components.
