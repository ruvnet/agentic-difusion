# Setting Up AdaptDiffuser: A Comprehensive Implementation Guide

AdaptDiffuser represents a significant advancement in diffusion models by enabling self-evolutionary planning capabilities across both seen and unseen tasks. This guide provides a detailed walkthrough for implementing AdaptDiffuser in both local environments and GitHub Codespaces, supporting both CPU and GPU configurations.

## Introduction to AdaptDiffuser

AdaptDiffuser is an evolutionary planning method that uses diffusion models to generate high-quality trajectories by leveraging reward gradient guidance. Published at ICML 2023 as an oral presentation, this model outperforms previous approaches by 20.8% on Maze2D and 7.5% on MuJoCo locomotion benchmarks, while demonstrating exceptional adaptability to unseen tasks[3][9][17].

Unlike conventional diffusion models, AdaptDiffuser can self-evolve to improve its planning capabilities through:
- Generating rich synthetic expert data using reward gradients
- Selecting high-quality data via a discriminator for fine-tuning
- Adapting to both seen and unseen tasks without requiring additional expert data[9][17]

## Implementation Option 1: Local Environment Setup

### Prerequisites

Before starting, ensure you have:
- Python 3.8+ installed
- CUDA-compatible GPU (for GPU acceleration)
- Git installed
- NVIDIA drivers (for GPU setup)

### Step 1: Clone the AdaptDiffuser Repository

```bash
git clone https://github.com/Liang-ZX/AdaptDiffuser.git
cd AdaptDiffuser
```

### Step 2: Set Up the Environment

You have two options for environment setup:

#### Option A: Using Conda (Recommended)

```bash
# Create a conda environment
conda env create -f environment.yml
conda activate diffuser_kuka

# Install the package locally
pip install -e .
```

#### Option B: Using pip with Virtual Environment

```bash
# Create a virtual environment
python -m venv adaptdiff_env
source adaptdiff_env/bin/activate  # On Windows, use: adaptdiff_env\Scripts\activate

# Install dependencies
pip install torch==1.9.1 # For CUDA 11.1 compatibility
pip install -r requirements.txt
pip install -e .
```

### Step 3: Set Environment Variables

Set the project root path:

```bash
export ADAPTDIFF_ROOT=$(pwd)
```

### Step 4: Download Required Datasets and Checkpoints

```bash
# Download and extract datasets and model checkpoints
wget  -O metainfo.tar.gz
tar -xzvf metainfo.tar.gz
ln -s metainfo/kuka_dataset ${ADAPTDIFF_ROOT}/kuka_dataset
ln -s metainfo/logs ${ADAPTDIFF_ROOT}/logs
```

Replace `` with the actual URL provided in the repository[1].

### Step 5: Run Training (KUKA Stacking Task)

```bash
# Train the unconditional diffusion model
python scripts/kuka.py --suffix my_experiment
```

Model checkpoints will be saved in `logs/multiple_cube_kuka_my_experiment_conv_new_real2_128`[1].

### Step 6: Evaluate the Model

For unconditional stacking:
```bash
python scripts/unconditional_kuka_planning_eval.py
```

For conditional stacking:
```bash
python scripts/conditional_kuka_planning_eval.py
```

Generated samples and videos will be logged to the `./results` directory[1].

## Implementation Option 2: GitHub Codespaces Setup

GitHub Codespaces provides a cloud-based development environment with the option for GPU acceleration. This approach eliminates the need for local installation of CUDA and other dependencies.

### Step 1: Set Up GitHub Codespaces

1. Fork the AdaptDiffuser repository to your GitHub account
2. Create a `.devcontainer` directory in the repository if it doesn't exist
3. Create a `devcontainer.json` file in the `.devcontainer` directory

### Step 2: Configure the DevContainer

Add the following content to your `devcontainer.json` file:

```json
{
  "name": "AdaptDiffuser Development",
  "image": "nvcr.io/nvidia/pytorch:22.07-py3",
  "customizations": {
    "vscode": {
      "extensions": [
        "ms-python.python",
        "ms-toolsai.jupyter"
      ]
    }
  },
  "features": {
    "ghcr.io/devcontainers/features/nvidia-cuda:1": {
      "installCudnn": true
    }
  },
  "runArgs": [
    "--gpus=all",
    "--ipc=host",
    "--ulimit", "memlock=-1",
    "--ulimit", "stack=67108864"
  ],
  "postCreateCommand": "pip install -e ."
}
```

This configuration uses NVIDIA's official PyTorch Docker image with CUDA support[18][19].

### Step 3: Launch GitHub Codespaces

1. Navigate to your forked repository on GitHub
2. Click the "Code" button
3. Select "Create codespace on main"
4. Wait for the environment to initialize

### Step 4: Set Up Project in Codespaces

Once the Codespace is running:

```bash
# Set environment variable
export ADAPTDIFF_ROOT=$(pwd)

# Download datasets and checkpoints
wget  -O metainfo.tar.gz
tar -xzvf metainfo.tar.gz
ln -s metainfo/kuka_dataset ${ADAPTDIFF_ROOT}/kuka_dataset
ln -s metainfo/logs ${ADAPTDIFF_ROOT}/logs
```

### Step 5: Run AdaptDiffuser in Codespaces

Follow the same training and evaluation steps as in the local setup:

```bash
# Train the model
python scripts/kuka.py --suffix codespace_run

# Evaluate unconditional stacking
python scripts/unconditional_kuka_planning_eval.py

# Evaluate conditional stacking
python scripts/conditional_kuka_planning_eval.py
```

## Adapting to CPU-Only Environment

If you don't have access to a GPU, you can still run AdaptDiffuser on CPU with some modifications:

```bash
# In your environment setup, install PyTorch without CUDA
pip install torch==1.9.1+cpu torchvision==0.10.1+cpu -f https://download.pytorch.org/whl/torch_stable.html

# When running scripts, add a flag to force CPU usage
export CUDA_VISIBLE_DEVICES=""
```

Note that training on CPU will be significantly slower than on GPU[1][2].

## Guided Trajectory Generation and Adaptation

Once the model is trained, you can use AdaptDiffuser's adaptive capabilities:

### Generate KUKA Stacking Data

```bash
python scripts/conditional_kuka_planning_eval.py \
  --env_name 'multiple_cube_kuka_temporal_convnew_real2_128' \
  --diffusion_epoch 650 \
  --save_render \
  --do_generate \
  --suffix my_generated_data \
  --eval_times 1000
```

This will generate synthetic expert data for the KUKA stacking task using the trained diffusion model[1].

### Adapt to Unseen Tasks

One of the key strengths of AdaptDiffuser is its ability to adapt to unseen tasks without requiring additional expert data. You can leverage this capability by using the reward gradient guidance during the diffusion denoising process:

```bash
# Example of adapting to a new task
python scripts/adapt_diffuser.py \
  --base_model_path logs/multiple_cube_kuka_my_experiment_conv_new_real2_128 \
  --new_task pick_and_place \
  --adaptation_steps 1000
```

## Performance Optimization Tips

1. **Batch Size Adjustment**: If you encounter memory issues on GPU, reduce the batch size in the configuration files
2. **Precision Control**: For faster training with minimal accuracy loss, consider using mixed precision training
3. **Data Parallelism**: For multi-GPU setups, utilize PyTorch's DistributedDataParallel for efficient training

## Troubleshooting Common Issues

1. **CUDA Out of Memory Errors**:
   - Reduce batch size
   - Use gradient accumulation
   - Free up unused tensors with `del` and `torch.cuda.empty_cache()`

2. **Import Errors**:
   - Ensure all dependencies are installed correctly
   - Check for version conflicts between packages

3. **Performance Issues on CPU**:
   - Consider using smaller model configurations
   - Reduce the dimensionality of the state and action spaces

## Conclusion

AdaptDiffuser represents a significant advancement in diffusion models for planning tasks, providing self-evolving capabilities that adapt to both seen and unseen environments. This implementation guide covers the essential steps for deploying AdaptDiffuser in both local and GitHub Codespaces environments, with support for both CPU and GPU configurations.

By following this guide, you can leverage AdaptDiffuser's powerful adaptive planning capabilities for your own applications in robotics, reinforcement learning, and beyond. The model's ability to generate high-quality trajectories guided by reward gradients makes it particularly valuable for complex planning tasks where traditional approaches may fall short[3][9][17].
